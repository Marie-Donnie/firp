This is the code for the site I created for my roleplay guild on World of Warcraft (Eu-Kirin Tor server).

It is built around character sheets for our characters, but there are other "modules" like the display of the spells we are using (based on warcraft rpg) or the display of campaign reports.

The forum is a simple phpbb.
